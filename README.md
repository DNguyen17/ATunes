We removed Shakira from our favorites tab (no offense Shakira) and we added Harry Potter and The Hills to it. 
Then we (almost forgot to) show those new items in our favorites tab


##Functionality
1. App allows user to be able to search through music vidoes, songs, movies, ebooks, podcasts and TV shows on iTunes
2. Advanced search allows users to search by title, by artists, or by genre. These will return the tracks associated
3. Users can see a more detailed version and (sometimes) description of their items.
3. Users can add their favorite item to home page

##Technology
1. We used SQLite for the backend
3. We used the material design library to implement our main activity with tab layout and fragments that link to new activities
4. We used glide, retrofit as well as jsonschema2pojo.org to develop this app
